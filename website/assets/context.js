Frank and Mirjam Pressler \nTranslated by Susan Massotty \n-- : -- \nBOOK FLAP \nAnne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl is among the most enduring documents of the \ntwentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has bee n read by tens of millions \nof people all over the world. It remains a beloved and deeply admired testament to the \nindestructable nature of the human spirit. \nRestore in this Definitive Edition are diary entries that ha d been omitted from the \noriginal edition. These passages, which constitute 30 perc ent more material, reinforce \nthe fact that Anne was first and foremost a teenage girl, not a remote and flawless \nsymbol. She fretted about, and tried to copie with, her own em erging sexuality. Like \nmany young girls, she often found herself in disagreement wi th her mother. And like \nany teenager, she veered between the carefree nature of a chi ld and the full-fledged \nsorrow of an adult. Anne emerges more human, more vulnerable , and more vital than \never. \nAnne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupa tion, hid in the back of \nan Amsterdam warehouse for two years. She was thirteen when t he family went into \nthe Secret Annex, and in these pages she grows to be a young wom an and a wise \nobserver of human nature as well. With unusual insight, she r eveals the relations \nbetween eight people living under extraordinary condition s, facing hunger, the \never-present threat of discovery and death, complete estra ngement from the outside \nworld, and above all, the boredom, the petty misunderstandings, and the frustrations of \nliving under such unbearable strain, in such confined quarters. \nA timely story rediscovered by each new generation, The Diary of a Young Girl stands \nwithout peer. For both young readers and adults it continues to bring to life this \nyoung woman, who for a time survived the worst horror of the modern world had seen \n-- and who remained triumphantly and heartbreakingly human throughout her ordeal. \nFor those who know and love Anne Frank, The Definitive Editio n is a chance to \ndiscover her anew. For readers who have not yet encountered h er, this is the edition \nto cherish. \nANNE FRANK was born on June 12, 1929. She died while imprisone d at \nBergen-Belsen, three months short of her sixteenth birthda y. OTTO H. FRANK was \nthe only member of his immediate framily to survive the Holoc aust. He died in 1980. \nMIRJAM PRESSLER is a popular writer of books for young adults . She lives in \nGermany. \nTranslated by Susan Massotty. \n-- : -- \nFOREWORD \nAnne Frank kept a diary from June 12, 1942, to August 1, 1944. I nitially, she wrote \nit strictly for herself. Then, one day in 1944, Gerrit Bolkes tein, a member of the \nDutch government in exile, announced in a radio broadcast fr om London that after the \nwar he hoped to collect eyewitness accounts of the suffering of the Dutch people \nunder the German occupation, which could be made available t o the public. As an \nexample, he specifically mentioned letters and diaries. \nImpressed by this speech, Anne Frank decided that when the war was over she would \npublish a book based on her diary. She began rewriting and edi ting her diary, \nimproving on the text, omitting passages she didn't think we re interesting enough and \nadding others from memory. At the same time, she kept up her or iginal diary. In the \nscholarly work The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition (1989), Anne's first, \nunedited diary is referred to as version a, to distinguish it from her second, edited \ndiary, which is known as version b. \nThe last entry in Anne's diary is dated August 1, 1944. On August 4, 1944, the eight \npeople hiding in the Secret Annex were arrested. Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, the two \nsecretaries working in the building, found Anne's diaries strewn allover the floor. ,Miep \nGies tucked them away in a desk drawer for safekeeping. After the war, when it \nbecame clear that Anne was dead, she gave the diaries, unread, to Anne's father, Otto \nFrank. \nAfter long deliberation, Otto Frank decided to fulfill his d aughter's wish and publish \nher diary. He selected material from versions a and b, editin g them into a shorter \nversion later referred to as version c. Readers all over the w orld know this as The \nDiary of a fauna Girl. \nIn making his choice, Otto Frank had to bear several points in mind. To begin with, \nthe book had to be kept short so that it would fit in with a serie s put out by the \nDutch publisher. In addition, several passages dealing wit h Anne's sexuality were \nomitted; at the time of the diary's initial publication, in 1947, it was not customary to \nwrite openly about sex, and certainly not in books for young adults. Out of respect for \nthe dead, Otto Frank also omitted a number of unflattering passages about his wife and \nthe other residents of the Secret Annex. Anne Frank, who was t hirteen when she \nbegan her diary and fifteen when she was forced to stop, wrote without reserve about \nher likes and dislikes. \nWhen Otto Frank died in 1980, he willed his daughter's manuscripts to the Netherlands \nState Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam. Becaus e the authenticity of the \ndiary had been challenged ever since its publication, the In stitute for War \nDocumentation ordered a thorough investigation. Once the d iary was proved, beyond a \nshadow of a doubt, to be genuine, it was published in its entir ety, along with the \nresults of an exhaustive study. The Critical Edition contai ns not only versions a, band \nc, but also articles on the background of the Frank family, th e circumstances \nsurrounding their arrest and deportation, and the examinat ion into Anne's handwriting, \nthe document and the materials used. \nThe Anne Frank-Fonds (Anne Frank Foundation) in Basel (Swit zerland),. which as \nOtto Frank's sole heir had also inherited his daughter's cop yrights, then decided to \nhave anew, expanded edition of the diary published for gener al readers. This new \nedition in no way affects the integrity of the old one origina lly edited by Otto Frank, \nwhich brought the diary and its message to millions of people . The task of compthng \nthe expanded edition was given to the writer and translator M irjam Pressler. Otto \nFrank's original selection has now been supplemented with passages from Anne's a and \nb versions. Mirjam Pressler's definitive edition, approve d by the Anne Frank-Fonds, \ncontains approximately 30 percent more material and is inte nded to give the reader \nmore insight into the world of Anne Frank. \nIn writing her second version (b), Anne invented pseudonyms for the people who \nwould appear in her book. She initially wanted to call hersel f Anne Aulis, and later \nAnne Robin. Otto Frank opted to call his family by their own na mes and to follow \nAnne's wishes with regard to the others. Over the years, the i dentity of the people \nwho helped the family in the Secret Annex has become common kn owledge. In this \nedition, the helpers are now referred to by their real names, as they so justly deserve \nto be. All other persons are named in accordance with the pseudonyms in The Critical \nEdition. The Institute for War Documentation has arbitrari ly assigned initials to those \npersons wishing to remain anonymous. \nThe real names of the other people hiding in the Secret Annex are: \nTHE VAN PELS FAMILY \n(from Osnabriick, Germany): \nAuguste van Pels (born September 9, 1890) \nHermann van Pels (born March 31, 1889) \nPeter van Pels (born November 8, 1926) \nCalled by Anne, in her manuscript: Petronella, Hans and Alfr ed van Daan; and in the \nbook: Petronella, Hermann and Peter van Daan. \nFRITZ PFEFFER \n(born April 30, 1889, in Giessen, Germany): \nCalled by Anne, in her manuscript and in the book: Alfred Dussel. \nThe reader may wish to bear in mind that much of this edition is based on the b \nversion of Anne's diary, which she wrote when she was around f ifteen years old. \nOccasionally, Anne went back and commented on a passage she h ad written earlier. \nThese comments are clearly marked in this edition. Naturall y, Anne's spelling and \nlinguistic errors have been corrected. Otherwise, the text has basically been left as \nshe wrote it, since any attempts at editing and clarification would be inappropriate in a \nhistorical document. \n-- : -- \nI hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have nev er been able to \nconfide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. \n-- : -- \nJune 12, 1942 \nI hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have nev er been able to \nconfide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. \nCOMMENT ADDED BY ANNE ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1942: So far you truly have been \na areat source of comfort to me, and so has Kitty, whom I now wri te to regularly. \nThis way of keeping a diary is much nicer, and now I can hardly w ait for those \nmoments when I'm able to write in you. Oh, I'm so alad I broughtyou along! \nSUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942 \nI'll begin from the moment I got you, the moment I saw you lying on the table among \nmy other birthday presents. (I went along when you were bough t, but that doesn't \ncount.) \nOn Friday, June 12, I was awake at six o'clock, which isn't sur prising, since it was \nmy birthday. But I'm not allowed to get up at that hour, so I had to control my \ncuriosity until quarter to seven. When I couldn't wait any lo nger, I went to the dining \nroom, where Moortje (the cat) welcomed me by rubbing against my legs. \nA little after seven I went to Daddy and Mama and then to the liv ing room to open \nmy presents, and you were the first thing I saw, maybe one of my nicest presents. \nThen a bouquet of roses, some peonies and a potted plant. From Daddy and Mama I \ngot a blue blouse, a game, a bottle of grape juice, which to my m ind tastes a bit like \nwine (after all, wine is made from grapes), a puzzle, a jar of cold cream, 2.50 guilders \nand a gift certificate for two books. I got another book as wel l, Camera Obscura (but \nMargot already has it, so I exchanged mine for something else ), a platter of \nhomemade cookies (which I made myself, of course, since I've become quite an expert \nat baking cookies), lots of candy and a strawberry tart from Mother. And a letter from \nGrammy, right on time, but of course that was just a coincidence. \nThen Hanneli came to pick me up, and we went to school. During recess I passed out \ncookies to my teachers and my class, and then it was time to get back to work. I \ndidn't arrive home until five, since I went to gym with the rest of the class. (I'm not \nallowed to take part because my shoulders and hips tend to get dislocated.) As it was \nmy birthday, I got to decide which game my classmates would pl ay, and I chose \nvolleyball. Afterward they all danced around me in a circle and sang \"Happy Birthday.\" \nWhen I got home, Sanne Ledermann was already there. Ilse Wagn er, Hanneli Goslar \nand Jacqueline van Maarsen came home with me after gym, since we're in the same \nclass. Hanneli and Sanne used to be my two best friends. People who saw us together \nused to say, \"There goes Anne, Hanne and Sanne.\" I only met Jacqueline van Maarsen \nwhen I started at the Jewish Lyceum, and now she's my best frie nd. Ilse is Hanneli's \nbest friend, and Sanne goes to another school and has friends there. \nThey gave me a beautiful book, Dutch Sasas and Lesends, but they gave me Volume II \nby mistake, so I exchanged two other books for Volume I. Aunt H elene brought me a \npuzzle, Aunt Stephanie a darling brooch and Aunt Leny a terri fic book: Daisy Goes to \nthe Mountains. \nThis morning I lay in the bathtub thinking how wonderful it wo uld be if I had a dog \nlike Rin Tin Tin. I'd call him Rin Tin Tin too, and I'd take him t o school with me, \nwhere he could stay in the janitor's room or by the bicycle rac ks when the weather \nwas good. \nMONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942 \nI had my birthday party on Sunday afternoon. The Rin Tin Tin mo vie was a big hit \nwith my classmates. I got two brooches, a bookmark and two boo ks. I'll start by \nsaying a few things about my school and my class, beginning with the students. \nBetty Bloemendaal looks kind of poor, and I think she probabl y is. She lives on some \nobscure street in West Amsterdam, and none of us know where it is. She does very \nwell at school, but that's because she works so hard, not beca use she's so smart. \nShe's pretty quiet. \nJacqueline van Maarsen is supposedly my best friend, but I've never had a real friend. \nAt first I thought Jacque would be one, but I was badly mistaken. \nD.Q.* [* Initials have been assigned at random to those perso ns who prefer to remain \nanonymous.] is a very nervous girl who's always forgetting t hings, so the teachers \nkeep assigning her extra homework as punishment. She's very kind, especially to G.Z. \nE.S. talks so much it isn't funny. She's always touching your hair or fiddling with your \nbuttons when she asks you something. They say she can't stand me, but I don't care, \nsince I don't like her much either. \nHenny Mets is a nice girl with a cheerful disposition, except that she talks in a loud \nvoice and is really childish when we're playing outdoors. Un fortunately, Henny has a \ngirlfriend named Beppy who's a bad influence on her because she's dirty and vulgar. \nJ.R. - I could write a whole book about her. J. is a detestable, sneaky, stuck-up, \ntwo-faced gossip who thinks she's so grown-up. She's really got Jacque under her \nspell, and that's a shame. J. is easily offended, bursts into tears at the slightest thing \nand, to top it all off, is a terrible show-off. Miss J. always h as to be right. She's \nvery rich, and has a closet full of the most adorable dresses that are way too old for \nher. She thinks she's gorgeous, but she's not. J. and I can't stand each other. \nIlse Wagner is a nice girl with a cheerful disposition, but sh e's extremely fInicky and \ncan spend hours moaning and groaning about something. Ilse likes me a lot. She's very \nsmart, but lazy. \nHanneli Goslar, or Lies as she's called at school, is a bit on t he strange side. She's \nusually shy -- outspoken at horne, but reserved around other people. She blabs \nwhatever you tell her to her mother. But she says what she thin ks, and lately I've \ncorne to appreciate her a great deal. \nNannie van Praag-Sigaar is small, funny and sensible. I thin k she's nice. She's pretty \nsmart. There isn't much else you can say about Nannie. Eefje d e Jong is, in my \nopinion, terrific. Though she's only twelve, she's quite the lady. She acts as if I were \na baby. She's also very helpful, and I like her. \nG.Z. is the prettiest girl in our class. She has a nice face, but is kind of dumb. I think \nthey're going to hold her back a year, but of course I haven't told her that. \nCOMMENT ADDED BY ANNE AT A LATER DATE: To my areat surprise, G. Z. \nwasn't held back a year after all. \nAnd sitting next to G.Z. is the last of us twelve girls, me. \nThere's a lot to be said about the boys, or maybe not so much after all. \nMaurice Coster is one of my many admirers, but pretty much of a pest. Sallie \nSpringer has a filthy mind, and rumor has it that he's gone all the way. Still, I think \nhe's terrific, because he's very funny. \nEmiel Bonewit is G.Z.'s admirer, but she doesn't care. He's p retty boring. Rob Cohen \nused to be in love with me too, but I can't stand him anymore. He 's an obnoxious, \ntwo-faced, lying, sniveling little goof who has an awfully high opinion of himself. \nMax van de Velde is a farm boy from Medemblik, but eminently su itable, as Margot \nwould say. \nHerman Koopman also has a filthy mind, just like Jopie de Beer , who's a terrible flirt \nand absolutely girl-crazy. \nLeo Blom is Jopie de Beer's best friend, but has been ruined byhis dirty mind. \nAlbert de Mesquita came from the Montessori School and skipped a grade. He's really \nsmart. \nLeo Slager came from the same school, but isn't as smart. \nRu Stoppelmon is a short, goofy boy from Almelo who transferr ed to this school in \nthe middle of the year. \nC.N. does whatever he's not supposed to. \nJacques Kocernoot sits behind us, next to C., and we (G. and I)laugh ourselves silly. \nHarry Schaap is the most decent boy in our class. He's nice. \nWerner Joseph is nice too, but all the changes taking place la tely have made him too \nquiet, so he seems boring. Sam Salomon is one of those tough gu ys from across the \ntracks. A real brat. (Admirer!) \nAppie Riem is pretty Orthodox, but a brat too. \nSATURDAY, JUNE 20,1942 \nWriting in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only \nbecause I've never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later \non neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen-year-old \nschoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn't matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater \nneed to get all kinds of things off my chest. \n\"Paper has more patience than people.\" I thought of this sayi ng on one of those days \nwhen I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home w ith my chin in my \nhands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed \nwhere I was, brooding. Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I'm not planning \nto let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly r eferred to as a \"diary,\" \nunless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won't make a bit of difference. \nNow I'm back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don't \nhave a friend. \nLet me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thi rteen year-old girl is \ncompletely alone in the world. And I'm not. I have loving pare nts and a \nsixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a \nthrong of admirers who can't keep their adoring eyes off me and who sometimes have \nto resort to using a broken pocket mirror to try and catch a gli mpse of me in the \nclassroom. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, o n the surface I seem \nto have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends \nis having a good time. I can't bring myself to talk about anyth ing but ordinary \neveryday things. We don't seem to be able to get any closer, an d that's the problem. \nMaybe it's my fault that we don't confide in each other. In any case, that's just how \nthings are, and unfortunately they're not liable to change. This is why I've started the \ndiary. \nTo enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagin ation, I don't want to \njot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, b ut I want the diary \nto be my friend, and I'm going to call this friend Kitty. \nSince no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right \nin, I'd better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so. \nMy father, the most adorable father I've ever seen, didn't ma rry my mother until he \nwas thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister Margot was born in Frankfurt am \nMain in Germany in 1926. I was born on June 12, 1929. I lived in F rankfurt until I \nwas four. Because we're Jewish, my father immigrated to Holl and in 1933, when he \nbecame the Managing Director of the Dutch Opekta Company, wh ich manufactures \nproducts used in making jam. My mother, Edith Hollander Fran k, went with him to \nHolland in September, while Margot and I were sent to Aachen t o stay with our \ngrandmother. Margot went to Holland in December, and I followed in February, when I \nwas plunked down on the table as a birthday present for Margot. \nI started right away at the Montessori nursery school. I stay ed there until I was six, \nat which time I started first grade. In sixth grade my teacher was Mrs. Kuperus, the \nprincipal. At the end of the year we were both in tears as we sai d a heartbreaking \nfarewell, because I'd been accepted at the Jewish Lyceum, where Margot also went to \nschool. \nOur lives were not without anxiety, since our relatives in Ge rmany were suffering \nunder Hitler's anti-Jewish laws. After the pogroms in 1938 m y two uncles (my \nmother's brothers) fled Germany, finding safe refuge in Nor th America. My elderly \ngrandmother came to live with us. She was seventy-three years old at the time. \nAfter May 1940 the good times were few and far between: first t here was the war, \nthen the capitulation and then the arrival of the Germans, wh ich is when the trouble \nstarted for the Jews. Our freedom was severely restricted by a series of anti-Jewish \ndecrees: Jews were required to wear a yellow star; Jews were r equired to turn in \ntheir bicycles; Jews were forbidden to use street-cars; Jews were forbidden to ride in \ncars, even their own; Jews were required to do their shopping between 3 and 5 P.M.; \nJews were required to frequent only Jewish-owned barbersho ps and beauty parlors; \nJews were forbidden to be out on the streets between 8 P.M. and 6 A.M.; Jews were \nforbidden to attend theaters, movies or any other forms of en tertainment; Jews were \nforbidden to use swimming pools, tennis courts, hockey fiel ds or any other athletic \nfields; Jews were forbidden to go rowing; Jews were forbidde n to take part in any \nathletic activity in public; Jews were forbidden to sit in their gardens or those of their \nfriends after 8 P.M.; Jews were forbidden to visit Christian s in their homes; Jews \nwere required to attend Jewish schools, etc. You couldn't do this and you couldn't do \nthat, but life went on. Jacque always said to me, \"I don't dare do anything anymore, \n'cause I'm afraid it's not allowed.\" \nIn the summer of 1941 Grandma got sick and had to have an operat ion, so my \nbirthday passed with little celebration. In the summer of 19 40 we didn't do much for \nmy birthday either, since the fighting had just ended in Holl and. Grandma died in \nJanuary 1942. No one knows how often I think of her and still love her. This birthday \ncelebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the others, and Grandma's candle was \nlit along with the rest. \nThe four of us are still doing well, and that brings me to the present date of June 20, \n1942, and the solemn dedication of my diary. \nSATURDAY, JUNE 20, 1942 \nDearest Kitty! Let me get started right away; it's nice and qu iet now. Father and \nMother are out and Margot has gone to play Ping-Pong with some other young people \nat her friend Trees's. I've been playing a lot of Ping-Pong my self lately. So much \nthat five of us girls have formed a club. It's called \"The Little Dipper Minus Two.\" A \nreally silly name, but it's based on a mistake. We wanted to gi ve our club a special \nname; and because there were five of us, we came up with the ide a of the Little \nDipper. We thought it consisted of five stars, but we turned o ut to be wrong. It has \nseven, like the Big Dipper, which explains the \"Minus Two.\" I lse Wagner has a \nPing-Pong set, and the Wagners let us play in their big dining room whenever we \nwant. Since we five Ping-Pong players like ice cream, especi ally in the summer, and \nsince you get hot playing Ping-Pong, our games usually end wi th a visit to the \nnearest ice-cream parlor that allows Jews: either Oasis or D elphi. We've long since \nstopped hunting around for our purses or money -- most of the t ime it's so busy in \nOasis that we manage to find a few generous young men of our acq uaintance or an \nadmirer to offer us more ice cream than we could eat in a week. \nYou're probably a little surprised to hear me talking about a dmirers at such a tender \nage. Unfortunately, or not, as the case may be, this vice seem s to be rampant at our \nschool. As soon as a boy asks if he can bicycle home with me and we get to talking, \nnine times out of ten I can be sure he'll become enamored on the spot and won't let \nme out of his sight for a second. His ardor eventually cools, e specially since I ignore \nhis passionate glances and pedal blithely on my way. If it get s so bad that they start \nrambling on about \"asking Father's permission,\" I swerve sl ightly on my bike, my \nschoolbag falls, and the young man feels obliged to get off hi s bike and hand me the \nbag, by which time I've switched the conversation to another topic. These are the \nmost innocent types. Of course, there are those who blow you k isses or try to take \nhold of your arm, but they're definitely knocking on the wrong door. I get off my bike \nand either refuse to make further use of their company or act a s if I'm insulted and \ntell them in no uncertain terms to go on home without me. There you are. We've now \nlaid the basis for our friendship. Until tomorrow. \nYours, Anne \nSUNDAY, JUNE 21, 1942 \nDearest Kitty, \nOur entire class is quaking in its boots. The reason, of cours e, is the upcoming \nmeeting in which the teachers decide who'll be promoted to th e next grade and who'll \nbe kept back. Half the class is making bets. G.Z. and I laugh ourselves sick at the two \nboys behind us, C.N. and Jacques Kocernoot, who have staked t heir entire vacation \nsavings on their bet. From morning to night, it's \"You're goi ng to pass, No, I'm not,\" \n\"Yes, you are,\" \"No, I'm not.\" Even G.'s pleading glances and my angry outbursts can't \ncalm them down. If you ask me, there are so many dummies that ab out a quarter of \nthe class should be kept back, but teachers are the most unpre dictable creatures on \nearth. Maybe this time they'll be unpredictable in the right direction for a change. I'm \nnot so worried about my girlfriends and myself. \nWe'll make it. The only subject I'm not sure about is math. Anyway, all we can do is \nwait. Until then, we keep telling each other not to lose heart. \nI get along pretty well with all my teachers. There are nine of them, seven men and \ntwo women. Mr. Keesing, the old fogey who teaches math, was ma d at me for the \nlongest time because I talked so much. After several warning s, he assigned me extra \nhomework. An essay on the subject \"A Chatterbox.\" A chatterbox, what can you write \nabout that? I'd wbrry about that later, I decided. I jotted do wn the assignment in my \nnotebook, tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet. \nThat evening, after I'd finished the rest of my homework, the note about the essay \ncaught my eye. I began thinking about the subject while chewi ng the tip of my \nfountain pen. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the \ntrick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the ne cessity of talking. I \nthought and thought, and suddenly I had an idea. I wrote the three pages Mr. Keesing \nhad assigned me and was satisfied. I argued that talking is a f emale trait and that I \nwould do my best to keep it under control, but that I would neve r be able to break \nmyself of the habit, since my mother talked as much as I did, if not more, and that \nthere's not much you can do about inherited traits. \nMr. Keesing had a good laugh at my arguments, but when I proceeded to talk my way \nthrough the next class, he assigned me a second essay. This ti me it was supposed to \nbe on \"An Incorrigible Chatterbox.\" I handed it in, and Mr. Ke esing had nothing to \ncomplain about for two whole classes. However, during the th ird class he'd finally had \nenough. \"Anne Frank, as punishment for talking in class, wri te an essay entitled \n'Quack, Quack, Quack,' said Mistress Chatterback.'\" \nThe class roared. I had to laugh too, though I'd ) nearly exhau sted my ingenuity on \nthe topic of chatterboxes. It was time to come up with somethi ng else, j something \noriginal. My friend Sanne, who's good at poetry, offered to h elp me write the essay \nfrom beginning to end in verse. I jumped for joy. Keesing was trying to play a joke on \nme with this ridiculous subject, but I'd make sure the joke wa s on him. I finished my \npoem, and it was beautiful! It was about a mother duck and a fat her swan with three \nbaby ducklings who were bitten to death by the father because they quacked too \nmuch. Luckily, Keesing took the joke the right way. He read th e poem to the class, \nadding his own comments, and to several other classes as well . Since then I've been \nallowed to talk and haven't been assigned any extra homework . On the contrary, \nKeesing's always i making jokes these days. \nYours, Anne \nWEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1942 \nDearest Kitty, \nIt's sweltering. Everyone is huffing and puffing, and in thi s heat I have to walk \neverywhere. Only now do I realize how pleasant a streetcar is , but we Jews are no \nlonger allowed to make use of this luxury; our own two feet are good enough for us. \nYesterday at lunchtime I had an appointment with the dentist on Jan Luykenstraat. It's \na long way from our school on Stadstimmertuinen. That aftern oon I nearly fell asleep \nat my desk. Fortunately, people automatically offer you something to drink. The dental \nassistant is really kind. \nThe only mode of transportation left to us is the ferry. The fe rryman at Josef \nIsraelkade took us across when we asked him to. It's not the fa ult of the Dutch that \nwe Jews are having such a bad time. \nI wish I didn't have to go to school. My bike was stolen during E aster vacation, and \nFather gave Mother's bike to some Christian friends for safe keeping. Thank goodness \nsummer vacation is almost here; one more week and our torment will be over. \nSomething unexpected happened yesterday morning. As I was p assing the bicycle \nracks, I heard my name being called. I turned around and there was the nice boy I'd \nmet the evening before at my friend Wilma's. He's Wilma's sec ond cousin. I used to \nthink Wilma was nice, which she is, but all she ever talks about is boys, and that gets \nto be a bore. He came toward me, somewhat shyly, and introduce d himself as Hello \nSilberberg. I was a little surprised and wasn't sure what he w anted, but it didn't take \nme long to find out. He asked if I would allow him to accompany m e to school. \"As \nlong as you're headed that way, I'll go with you,\" I said. And s o we walked together. \nHello is sixteen and good at telling all kinds of funny stories. \nHe was waiting for me again this morning, and I expect he will be from now on. \nAnne \nWEDNESDAY, JULY 1, 1942 \nDearest Kitty, \nUntil today I honestly couldn't find the time to write you. I w as with friends all day \nThursday, we had company on Friday, and that's how it went until today. \nHello and I have gotten to know each other very well this past w eek, and he's told \nme a lot about his life. He comes from Gelsenkirchen and is liv ing with his \ngrandparents. His parents are in Belgium, but there's no way he can get there. Hello \nused to have a girlfriend named Ursula. I know her too. She's p erfectly sweet and \nperfectly boring. Ever since he met me, Hello has realized that he's been falling asleep \nat Ursul's side. So I'm kind of a pep tonic. You never know whatyou're good for! \nJacque spent Saturday night here. Sunday afternoon she was a t Hanneli's, and I was \nbored stiff. \nHello was supposed to come over that evening, but he called ar ound six. I answered \nthe phone, and he said, \"This is Helmuth Silberberg. May I please speak to Anne?\" \n\"Oh, Hello. This is Anne.\" \n\"Oh, hi, Anne. How are you?\" \" \n\"Fine, thanks.\" \n\"I just wanted to say I'm sorry but I can't come tonight, though I would like to have a \nword with you. Is it all right if I come by and pick you up in about ten minutes \n\"Yes, that's fine. Bye-bye!\" \n\"Okay, I'll be right over. Bye-bye!\" \nI hung up, quickly changed my clothes and fixed my hair. I was s o nervous I leaned \nout the window to watch for him. He finally showed up. Miracle of miracles, I didn't \nrush down the stairs, but waited quietly until he rang the bel l. I went down to open \nthe door, and he got right to the point. \n\"Anne, my grandmother thinks you're too young for me to be see ing you on a regular \nbasis. She says I should be going to the Lowenbachs', but you probably know that I'm \nnot going out with Ursul anymore.\" \n\"No, I didn't know. What happened? Did you two have a fight?\" \n\"No, nothing like that. I told Ursul that we weren't suited to each other and so it was \nbetter for us not to go together anymore, but that she was welcome at my house and \nI hoped I would be welcome at hers. Actually, I thought Ursul w as hanging around \nwith another boy, and I treated her as if she were. But that wasn't true. And then my \nuncle said I should apologize to her, but of course I didn't fe el like it, and that's why \nI broke up with her. But that was just one of the reasons. \n\"Now my grandmother wants me to see Ursul and not you, but I don 't agree and I'm \nnot going to. Sometimes old people have really old-fashione d ideas, but that doesn't \nmean I have to go along with them. I need my grandparents, but i n a certain sense \nthey need me too. From now on I'll be free on Wednesday evening s. You see, my \ngrandparents made me sign up for a wood-carving class, but ac tually I go to a club \norganized by the Zionists. My grandparents don't want me to g o, because they're \nanti-Zionists. I'm not a fanatic Zionist, but it interests m e. Anyway, it's been such a \nmess lately that I'm planning to quit. So next Wednesday will be my last meeting. \nThat means I can see you Wednesday evening, Saturday afterno on, Saturday evening, \nSunday afternoon and maybe even more.\" \n\"But if your grandparents don't want you to, you? shouldn't go behind their backs.\" \n\"All's fair in love and war.\" \nJust then we passed Blankevoort's Bookstore and there was Pe ter Schiff with two \nother boys; it was the first time he'd said hello to me in ages, and it really made me \nfeel good. \nMonday evening Hello came over to meet Father and Mother. I had bought a cake and \nsome candy, and we had tea and cookies, the works, but neither Hello nor I felt like \nsitting stiffly on our chairs. So we went out for a walk, and he didn't deliver me to \nmy door until ten past eight. Father was furious. He said it was very wrong of me not \nto get home on time. I had to promise to be home by ten to eight in the future. I've \nbeen asked to Hello's on Saturday. \nWilma told me that one night when Hello was at her house, she as ked him, \"Who do \nyou like best, Ursul or Anne?\" \nHe said, \"It's none of your business.\" \nBut as he was leaving (they hadn't talked to each other the res t of the evening), he \nsaid, \"Well, I like Anne better, but don't tell anyone. Bye!\" And whoosh. . . he was \nout the door. \nIn everything he says or does, I can see that Hello is in love wi th me, and it's kind \nof nice for a change. Margot would say that Hello is eminently suitable. I think so too, \nbut he's more than that. Mother is also full of praise: \"A good -looking boy. Nice and \npolite.\" I'm glad he's so popular with everyone. Except with my girlfriends. He thinks \nthey're very childish, and he's right about that. Jacque sti ll teases me about him, but \nI'm not in love with him. Not really. It's all right for me to ha ve boys as friends. \nNobody minds. \nMother is always asking me who I'm going to marry when I grow up , but I bet she'll \nnever guess it's Peter, because I talked her out of that idea myself, without batting an \neyelash. I love Peter as I've never loved anyone, and I tell my self he's only going \naround with all those other girls to hide his feelings for me. Maybe he thinks Hello \nand I are in love with each other, which we're not. He's just a f riend, or as Mother \nputs it, a beau. \nYours, Anne \nSUNDAY, JULY 5, 1942 \nDear Kitty, \nThe graduation ceremony in the Jewish Theater on Friday went as expected. My \nreport card wasn't too bad. I got one D, a C- in algebra and all t he rest B's, except \nfor two B+'s and two B-'s. My parents are pleased, but they're not like other parents \nwhen it comes to grades. They never worry about report cards, good or bad. As long \nas I'm healthy and happy and don't talk back too much, they're satisfied. If these three \nthings are all right, everything else will take care of itself. \nI'm just the opposite. I don't want to be a poor student. I was accepted to the Jewish \nLyceum on a conditional basis. I was supposed to stay in the se venth grade at the \nMontessori School, but when Jewish children were required t o go to Jewish schools, \nMr. Elte finally agreed, after a great deal of persuasion, to accept Lies Goslar and me. \nLies also passed this year, though she has to repeat her geometry exam. \nPoor Lies. It isn't easy for her to study at home; her baby sist er, a spoiled little \ntwo-year-old, plays in her room all day. If Gabi doesn't get h er way, she starts \nscreaming, and if Lies doesn't look after her, Mrs. Goslar st arts screaming. So Lies \nhas a hard time doing her homework, and as long as that's the case, the tutoring she's \nbeen getting won't help much. The Goslar household is really a sight. Mrs. Goslar's \nparents live next door, but eat with the family. The there's a hired girl, the baby, the \nalways absentminded and absent Mr. Goslar and the always ner vous and irrita Ie Mrs. \nGoslar, who's expecting another baby. Lies, who's all thumbs, gets lost in the mayhem. \nMy sister Margot has also gotten her report card. \nBrilliant, as usual. If we had such a thing as \"cum laude,\" she would have passed with \nhonors, she's so smart. \nFather has been home a lot lately. There's nothing for him to do at the office; it must \nbe awful to feel you're not needed. Mr. Kleiman has taken over Opekta, and Mr. \nKugler, Gies & Co., the company dealing in spices and spice su bstitutes that was set \nup in 1941. \nA few days ago, as we were taking a stroll around our neighborh ood square, Father \nbegan to talk about going into hiding. He said it would be very hard for us to live cut \noff from the rest of the world. I asked him why he was bringing this up now. \n\"Well, Anne,\" he replied, \"you know that for more than a year w e've been bringing \nclothes, food and furniture to other people. We don't want our belongings to be seized \nby the Germans. Nor do we want to fall into their clutches ours elves. So we'll leave \nof our own accord and not wait to be hauled away.\" \n\"But when, Father?\" He sounded so serious that I felt scared.\n\"Don't you worry. We'll take care of everything. just enjoy y our carefree life while \nyou can.\" \nThat was it. Oh, may these somber words not come true for as long as possible. \nThe doorbell's ringing, Hello's here, time to stop. \nYours, Anne \nWEDNESDAY, JULY 8, 1942 \nDearest Kitty, \nIt seems like years since Sunday morning. So much has happene d it's as if the whole \nworld had suddenly turned upside down. But as you can see, Kitty, I'm still alive, and \nthat's the main thing, Father says. I'm alive all right, but don't ask where or how. You \nprobably don't understand a word I'm saying today, so I'll be gin by telling you what \nhappened Sunday afternoon. \nAt three o'clock (Hello had left but was supposed to come back later), the doorbell \nrang. I didn't hear it, since I was out on the balcony, lazily reading in the sun. A little \nwhile later Margot appeared in the kitchen doorway looking v ery agitated. \"Father has \nreceived a call-up notice from the SS,\" she whispered. \"Moth er has gone to see Mr. \nvan Daan\" (Mr. van Daan is Father's business partner and a good friend.) \nI was stunned. A call-up: everyone knows what that means. Vis ions of concentration \ncamps and lonely cells raced through my head. How could we let Father go to such a \nfate? \"Of course he's not going,\" declared Margot as we waite d for Mother in the \nliving room. \"Mother's gone to Mr. van Daan to ask whether we c an move to our \nhiding place tomorrow. The van Daans are going with us. There will be seven of us \naltogether.\" Silence. We couldn't speak. The thought of Fat her off visiting someone in \nthe Jewish Hospital and completely unaware of what was happe ning, the long wait for \nMother, the heat, the suspense -- all this reduced us to silence. \nSuddenly the doorbell rang again. \"That's Hello,\" I said. \n\"Don't open the door!\" exclaimed Margot to stop me. But it was n't necessary, since \nwe heard Mother and Mr. van Daan downstairs talking to Hello, and then the two of \nthem came inside and shut the door behind them. Every time the bell rang, either \nMargot or I had to tiptoe downstairs to see if it was Father, and we didn't let anyone \nelse in. Margot and I were sent from the room, as Mr. van Daan wa nted to talk to \nMother alone. \nWhen she and I were sitting in our bedroom, Margot told me that the call-up was not \nfor Father, but for her. At this second shock, I began to cry. M argot is sixteen -- \napparently they want to send girls her age away on their own. But thank goodness she \nwon't be going; Mother had said so herself, which must be what Father had meant \nwhen he talked to me about our going into hiding. Hiding. . . where would we hide? In \nthe city? In the country? In a house? In a shack? When, where, h ow. . . ? These \nwere questions I wasn't allowed to ask, but they still kept running through my mind. \nMargot and I started packing our most important belongings into a schoolbag. The first \nthing I stuck in was this diary, and then curlers, handkerchi efs, schoolbooks, a comb \nand some old letters. Preoccupied by the thought of going int o hiding, I stuck the \ncraziest things in the bag, but I'm not sorry. Memories mean m ore to me than \ndresses. \nFather finally came hQme around five o'clock, and we called M r. Kleiman to ask if he \ncould come by that evening. Mr. van Daan left and went to get Miep. Miep arrived and \npromised to return later that night, taking with her a bag ful l of shoes, dresses, \njackets, underwear and stockings. After that it was quiet in our apartment; none of us \nfelt like eating. It was still hot, and everything was very strange. \nWe had rented our big upstairs room to a Mr. Goldschmidt, a div orced man in his \nthirties, who apparently had nothing to do that evening, sin ce despite all our polite \nhints he hung around until ten o'clock. \nMiep and Jan Gies came at eleven. Miep, who's worked for Fathe r's company since \n1933, has become a close friend, and so has her husband Jan. On ce again, shoes, \nstockings, books and underwear disappeared into Miep's bag and Jan's deep pockets. At \neleven-thirty they too disappeared. \nI was exhausted, and even though I knew it'd be my last night in my own bed, I fell \nasleep right away and didn't wake up until Mother called me at five-thirty the next \nmorning. Fortunately, it wasn't as hot as Sunday; a warm rain fell throughout the day. \nThe four of us were wrapped in so many layers of clothes it look ed as if we were \ngoing off to spend the night in a refrigerator, and all that just so we could take more \nclothes with us. No Jew in our situation would dare leave the h ouse with a suitcase \nfull of clothes. I was wearing two undershirts, three pairs o f underpants, a dress, and \nover that a skirt, a jacket, a raincoat, two pairs of stocking s, heavy shoes, a cap, a \nscarf and lots more. I was suffocating even before we left the house, but no one \nbothered to ask me how I felt. \nMargot stuffed her schoolbag with schoolbooks, went to get her bicycle and, with Miep \nleading the way, rode off into the great unknown. At any rate, that's how I thought of \nit, since I still didn't know where our hiding place was. \nAt seven-thirty we too closed the door behind us; Moortje, my cat, was the only \nliving creature I said good-bye to. According to a note we lef t for Mr. Goldschmidt, \nshe was to be taken to the neighbors, who would give her a good home. \nThe stripped beds, the breakfast things on the table, the pound of meat for the cat in \nthe kitchen -- all of these created the impression that we'd l eft in a hurry. But we \nweren't interested in impressions. We just wanted to get out of there, to get away and \nreach our destination in safety. Nothing else mattered. \nMore tomorrow. \nYours, Anne \nTHURSDAY, JULY 9, 1942 \nDearest Kitty, \nSo there we were, Father, Mother and I, walking in the pouring rain, each of us with \na schoolbag and a shopping bag filled to the brim with the most varied assortment of \nitems. The people on their way to work at that early hour gave us sympathetic looks; \nyou could tell by their faces that they were sorry they couldn't offer us some kind of \ntransportation; the conspicuous yellow star spoke for itself. \nOnly when we were walking down the street did Father and Mothe r reveal, little by \nlittle, what the plan was. For months we'd been moving as much of our furniture and \napparel out of the apartment as we could. It was agreed that we 'd go into hiding on \nJuly 16. Because of Margot's call-up notice, the plan had to b e moved up ten days, \nwhich meant we'd have to make do with less orderly rooms. \nThe hiding place was located in Father's office building. Th at's a little hard for \noutsiders to understand, so I'll explain. Father didn't hav e a lot of people working in \nhis office, just Mr. Kugler, Mr. Kleiman, Miep and a twenty-t hree-year-old typist \nnamed Bep Voskuijl, all of whom were informed of our coming. M r. Voskuijl, Bep's \nfather, works in the warehouse, along with two assistants, n one of whom were told \nanything. \nHere's a description of the building. The large warehouse on the ground floor is used \nas a workroom and storeroom and is divided into several diffe rent sections, such as \nthe stockroom and the milling room, where cinnamon, cloves a nd a pepper substitute \nare ground. \nNext to the warehouse doors is another outside' door, a separ ate entrance to the \noffice. Just inside the office door is a second door, and beyond that a stairway. At the \ntop of the stairs is another door, with a frosted window on which the word \"Office\" is \nwritten in black letters. This is the big front office -- very large, very light and \nvery full. Bep, Miep and Mr. Kleiman work there during the day. After passing through \nan alcove containing a safe, a wardrobe and a big supply cupbo ard, you come to the \nsmall, dark, stuffy back office. This used to be shared by Mr. Kugler and Mr. van \nDaan, but now Mr. Kugler is its only occupant. Mr. Kugler's office can also be reached \nfrom the hallway, but only through a glass door that can be ope ned from the inside \nbut not easily from the outside. If you leave Mr. Kugler's off ice and proceed through \nthe long, narrow hallway past the coal bin and go up four steps , you find yourself in \nthe private office, the showpiece of the entire building. El egant mahogany furniture, a \nlinoleum floor covered with throw rugs, a radio, a fancy lamp , everything first class. \nNext door is a spacious kitchen with a hot-water heater and tw o gas burners, and \nbeside that a bathroom. That's the second floor. \nA wooden staircase leads from the downstairs hallway to the third floor. At the top of \nthe stairs is a landing, with doors on either side. The door on the left takes you up to \nthe spice storage area, attic and loft in the front part of the house. A typically Dutch, \nvery steep, ankle-twisting flight of stairs also runs from t he front part of the house \nto another door opening onto the street. \nThe door to the right of the landing leads to the \"Secret Annex \" at the back ofthe \nhouse. No one would ever suspect there were so many rooms behi nd that plain gray \ndoor. There's just one small step in front of the door, and then you're inside. Straight \nahead of you is a steep flight of stairs. To the left is a narrow hallway opening onto \na room that serves as the Frank family's living \n[INSERT MAP HERE] \n";
